# ElixirUI
Simple example of using a C# WPF application as the user interface for an Elixir application

This program can be used with my example program here: https://github.com/frank-taylor-pcg/tortuga.

Both are crude at the moment, more prototypes than anything to begin educating myself in how Elixir's ports work.
